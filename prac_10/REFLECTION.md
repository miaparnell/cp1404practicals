### Mia Parnell - Prac 10

* regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during 
the course of the subject?

    I think my estimates became more accurate throughout the trimester. However, there were definitely some programs
    that took quite a bit longer (or sometimes shorter) than I had originally thought they would.


* regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
    
    Giving the code reviews helped to teach me more about what to look for when editing/revising code, including when it
    is my own code. I think this helped me to improve my own code when I would look over it after writing it. Receiving 
    reviews also helped me to notice things that I wouldn't have noticed if someone else wouldn't have pointed it out, 
    and this gave me something to look out for when writing new code.


* regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
    I would try to separate the practicals up more, because I often found myself trying to complete the majority of a 
    prac in 1-2 sittings, when I think it would be much better if it were more separated, such that I only worked on 1-2
    programs at a time. I would also start them a little earlier, as there were some times when I procrastinated 
    beginning the pracs, which could lead to stress.


Include proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
