# Practical 07

## CP1404, Week 7

Student Name: Mia Parnell

Major: Data Science

Repo: cp1404practicals, prac_07. Contains practical work for the practical due in week 7

Three lessons I have learned about "clean code" in this subject:

- Use functions to make code more readable and easy to understand, as well as being able to be reused sometimes
- Always use good variable names, even if you could use an abbreviation or something else this will likely make it more
  difficult in the future
- Do not create maintenance burdens in code in case things need to be changed in the future
